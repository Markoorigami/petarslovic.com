[Smart Email Field](http://petarslovic.github.io/smart-email-field/) is a js plugin that can autocomplete email addresses. When you start typing your email, and hit the `@` symbol, it starts offering common email domains to autocomplete.

You can apply it to any input field, and it will use those custom styles and perfectly blend in with it.

I think it could be usefull if people started using it on their sites, but it does have a few issues that are yet to be solved. You can report an issue [here](https://github.com/petarslovic/smart-email-field/issues).
