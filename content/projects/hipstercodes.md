[HipsterCodes](http://hipstercodes.com) is a new blog that I started. It's hipster poster quotes with programming humor. I made it with Hugo, a static blog generator writen in Go.

Currently it's got close to 100 posters, and I'm always working on more. Gotta get that inspiration juice going!

I use [Pixteller](http://www.pixteller.com/) to create posters. The interface is not perfect, but I think overall it's much better than Pablo, Buffer's take on the matter.
