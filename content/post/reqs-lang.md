I had this idea to have all project requirements and tasks in one file, which is checked into your version control, so it's easy to reach, and it evolves with the code. I tried the concept out on a side project, and it seemed to work pretty well for me. So I thought it would be a cool idea to define the structure that a requirements file would follow, which would make this approach repetable and well organized, but also flexible. That's how ReqsLang was born.

I hope that people will find the idea interesting, and that we can start a discussion on how to make it better!
